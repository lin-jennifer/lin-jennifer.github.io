This process, especially as a first-generation college student, was challenging for me. Fortunately, I had great mentors in the process1. I wanted to take this opportunity to discuss some of the experiences that I had, things that worked for me, and opportunities that aspiring graduate students can take advantage of in their journeys.\nThis post assumes that you have already determined which programs that you are going to apply to. For Political Science, most applications entail applying to the department, which means that learning about the opportunities and work that current faculty and graduate students there do can be a good place to start compiling the list of programs. In picking programs, approach this with purpose \u0026ndash; think about some reach programs, some target and some safety that might work for you. It can also help to know the network of your letter writers and use that to inform your search.\nPlease Note: I am not a professional advisor for graduate school application. I am largely speaking for my experience going through this process with reasonable success\nContents   Main Components   The GRE  Transcripts and GPA  Writing Sample  CV  Letters of Recommendation  Statement of Purpose    Opportunities for Minority Students   Application Fee Waiver  Diversity Visit Weekends    Components of the Graduate Application Depending on the program, there may be some differences in the exact requirements of the application. However, there are 6 main sections that generally apply across most Ph.D. applications, certainly in Political Science.\nThe GRE My best advice: take it once when you feel confident and ready. It\u0026rsquo;s a 4 hour computer-based test and costs $205 \u0026ndash; In other words, it is long, expensive and an experience that is best when had only once. I recognize that, by saying this, it assumes that you have the luxury of time to choose when it is best for you to test. Since you can test anytime until mid-November of Fall semester, which is basically 3 weeks before most applications are due, it is possible that you might be in a situation where you just have to do it to get the best possible score for this cycle2.\nAnd to be clear, I do not recommend waiting until the last mintue to test. Many people have told me that testing during Spring or Summer of your junior year may be a good option. When considering when you should take your GRE, look at your calendar and ballpark a date. Unlike the SATs and ACTs for high school, GRE test slots are available almost every day of the week with many places near you that can administer the test.3 As a result, it is up to you to plan for a time that is most comfortable and a time you feel most prepared to test.\nPreparing for the Test: Other than planning on when/where to take the test, I highly recomment preparing for the test itself. On social media, I have seen numerous advice boards where people say that, if you are good in English or math, you can just test without a problem. Even if you are a math geek or have an broad vocabulary, I still recommend going through a practice guide to work out the problems and taking a few practice tests using PowerPrep Plus, which is ETS\u0026rsquo;s test similator.\nTesting with Accommodations: If you have ADA accommodations through your college/workplace, I highly recommend applying them for the GRE. To apply, consult the Accommodations for Test Takers with Disabilities or Health-related Needs for more information. As the page suggests, this process takes some time, which means that it would require more planning on your end to detwemine when you want to take the test and submit documentation with ample time to ensure that everything gets processed in a timely manner.\nTranscripts and GPA Each graduate program has different requirements for how to submit a transcript. Most of them require a scan of an official transcript and only want sealed copies once you confirm that you are attending their program. Others might require mailed copies in the application process and still others might ask for a sealed copy in order to send you an acceptance letter. Understanding the transcript requirements early on can save you some money in the process. I recommend reading through the requirements for all your programs to best plan for when to order, the number of copies to order, and where to send them. By default, you should plan to order one scan copy for all the applications and add to reflect the differences in application requirements.\nSchools without GPAs: If you attend a college without a GPA, as I did, reach out to the Director of Graduate Studies (DGS) or Graduate Coordinator of your intended program(s) and ask about how you should go about filling out the GPA field. In your email, you should also ask about how you can submit any documents that reflect course performance. In my case, it was narrative evaluations that, fortunately, were part of my transcript so I sent a massive file with all of those documents.\nWriting Sample The Writing Sample is your opportunity to demonstrate competence in research skills. When selecting your sample, consider a piece that accurately captures your research interests and showcases your ability to collect data, run analyses, and communicate your findings.\nThe advice that I got in this step was to take care of each section because you would not know which section the admissions committee would read. They might read the entire paper, they might read a section, they might skim \u0026ndash; either way, it is not a document where you want typos hanging around. In other words, if you are submitting a final paper from a class last year, be sure to still read it over before submitting it.\nFor reference, here is my writing sample. It was a shortened version of the fourth chapter of my honors thesis. In my case, I might say that my writing sample helped get me into some of my programs as professors who I wanted to work with emailed me to tell me how they liked my sample and how it aligned with projects that they wanted to do. My point in mentioning this is to say that you should not simply select any paper to submit, but to think carefully about the research that you are trying to do in graduate school and have this paper be a reflection of those goals. This paper should, ideally, also demonstrate the potential that you have to the learn and apply some of the core research and statistical methods that you would need in your career.\nCV/Resume Your CV/Resume is your opportunity to showcase your experiences in and out of academia. While some of these experiences, most notably those related to research projects or teaching experiences, will be on your statement of purpose, activities that demonstrate transferable skills such as public speaking or leadership in clubs/sports might not be on the statement. That is why your CV is an important part of your application \u0026ndash; it helps to demonstrate your achievements but also show the diverse experiences that you had.\nAt the same time, while your CV is a good place to describe campus jobs or co-curricular activities, it can also help make your case as a researcher to use the descriptions to demonstrate experience and competence with research, time-management, organization and communication related skills.\nI quasi-templated my own CV that I used in my application to demonstrate possible sections that can be used in your own CV. It is available here on Overleaf in $\\mathrm{\\LaTeX}$ format. The PDF should be available for download and the format is easy to emulate in Word. For $\\mathrm{\\LaTeX}$ users, you are welcome to make a copy of the code and work off that copy for your resume.\nYour CV is also a document that would take time and revisions. I highly recommend consulting a career coach in your career center or a professor for advice on ways to refine your CV.\nLetters of Recommendation Letter of Recommendations are opportunities for others to make an impression on your behalf. Most applications will require 3 professional references from professors, supervisors, or other professional references \u0026ndash; in other words, not family or friends. For research-based Ph.D. programs, I recommend selecting recommenders who you know in either a research or teaching experience. This might be a Primary Investigator (PI) in a lab that you worked in or an instructor for a class that you were a Teaching Assistant (TA). They should know you fairly well and agree to write a good letter for your application.\nThink about your letter writers early and let them know that you are interested in asking them for a letter for graduate applications as early in the process as possible. As soon as you know which programs you are applying to, let your letter writers know of the deadlines and send them information on how to submit their letters. They might ask you to provide them with your application materials, so be sure to send that information to them in a timely manner so that they have ample time to prepare their letters (spproxinately 3-4 weeks before the deadline).\nWhen you hear back from your programs, be sure to let your letter writers know the results regardless of whether or not you were accepted.\nStatement of Purpose If you google \u0026ldquo;How to write a (good) Statement of Purpose for graduate school\u0026rdquo; (or something to that effect), you will largely get blog posts or lists of ways to write a bad statement of purpose, or a list of things not to do. The reason for this is that there is not necessarily a hard-and-fast recipe for writing a good statement of purpose but there are certainly many ways that you can do it wrong. When writing your statement of purpose, look at some of those! To put it quite bluntly, it is better for the internet to warn you in their list of don\u0026rsquo;ts than to be rejected from a program for these mistakes.\nWhen reading your application requirements, many of them will just have a place to upload a statement of purpose without much else in terms of directions. However, some departments will specify what they want to see in terms of content, word count or page limits. Be sure to research these requirements and keep time in mind as you write you statement of purpose.\nFor a general statement of purpose, it is best o limit it to 2 pages. Some good things to discuss in your statement can include any research plans that you have, career goals, past research experience, and why you want to attend graduate school, especially in the particular program in which you are applying.\nIn the process of writing the statement of purpose, it is helpful to get several people to review and revise your statement. It is a part of your application that may require the most time. Revising the statement with different input can help strengthen your writing, catch typos and provide insight on things to add or change. I recommend seeking a diverse group of people who might know you in different contexts to help with different components of the statement. Having a friend who knows your background or an advisor who knows your research look over your statement allows them to provide you with insight on how you can add or change pieces to put your best foot forward.\nOpportunities for Minority Students I\u0026rsquo;ve seen posts on Twitter and Facebook numerous times about how higher education inherently gives an edge to wealthy white individuals and application fees make this endeavor inaccessible for low income students. There are some things colleges/universities are doing to address the problem and this may help you in your application if you qualify.\nApplication Fee Waivers If you are a member of an undergraduate research program for minorities such as McNair or SROP, or if you receive a Pell Grant from your FAFSA, you can qualify for application fee waivers to most of your programs. Be sure to look into these early on. Some schools are specific in how you can acquire a waiver and they might require additional materials in order to secure this waiver. You can often find instructions by simply conducting a google search of \u0026ldquo;[SCHOOL NAME] Graduate Application Fee Waiver\u0026rdquo;\nDiversity Visit Weekends Some graduate schools also conduct diversity visit weekends. These are often full expense paid trips to visit a graduate program for a weekend before the application is due. To qualify for these, you would need to be from a diverse background as defined by the program. These opportunities allow you to network with members from the department that you are applying to, learn more about the application process and about graudate school in general, and provide you an opportunity to ask questions. These opportunities often come with application waivers to the school itself.

And this is for a good reason. Academic is quite easy to use and it is very flexible to the needs of the user, allowing creators to design web pages using a variety of widgets and even allowing them to create some new ones.\nThen, you may ask, why are you writing this post? Well, as the title suggests, there were a few things I learned that I wanted to document for my future self and for those wishing to pick this theme up. Many users have also done something similar, with great examples being from George Cushen, the creator of Academic, and Allison Hill, a coauthor on Blogdown. I should note that this post is not necessarily geared towards a setp-by-step on how to create a website using Hugo themes, as those tips are documented by the creators of the themes themselves.\nWhat I Wish I Knew Let\u0026rsquo;s begin with the second question because I think it is more straightforward and something that people who want to use this theme should know \u0026ndash; Academic is so simple, yet complex.\nGiven the amount of documentation that Academic and their community of users provide on the internet, it is easy to understand the \u0026ldquo;simple\u0026rdquo; component. Academic relies on Markdown, or R Markdown if you would prefer.\nBut, the more complicated part comes with the organization of the site, which, for beginners, may come with a learning curve. I created my site using Blogdown, but there are many ways that one can use to create and deploy an Academic site. But regardless of what you end up choosing, the first few hours, maybe days, would be dedicated to you constantly asking yourself: \u0026ldquo;Where is that file?\u0026rdquo; The Blogdown book, which I recommend looking through if you choose Blogdown, suggests a 10 minute curve for users not familiar with code in CSS or JavaScript, but my personal experience showed that it took a lot longer for me to get accustomed to the site and framework.\nHowever, the good news is that once you get over the learning curve, it is quite easy to edit and innovate your Academic site.\nWhat I Learned Please note that this list was based on the structure of Version 4.9. I will continue to update this list as I learn more\nAs I discussed earlier, there can be a learning curve to the site. In the rest of this post, I will attempt to document all the tips I found handy in my process of getting accustomed to the site. In this process, I assume that you are using Blogdown and have read the book to know how to initiate an Academic site1\n Assuming you don\u0026rsquo;t already know Markdown, learn some basic syntax. Academic\u0026rsquo;s documentation provides a great guide to do this. It also helps to have a general understanding of HTML syntax as well. Bookmark some cheat sheets. I recommend:   Font Awesome general (fas) and Font Awesome Brand (fab)  Academicons  Emojis Cheatsheet  HTML Symbols Cheatsheet   Build your site often to see if there are errors. I recommend using the blogdown:::serve_site() command, which, if you use R Studio, generates a preview in a viewer tab in your screen. Regardless of the approach you use to create and edit your site, DO NOT TOUCH the themes/ folder in your site source. You can mirror the file structure under the themes/ folder to create your own content, as explained here. When building with Blogdown and deplaying to GitHub pages, I recommend using a two repository system where one serves as the source and the other is the publish directory. This is because there are some challenges for GitHub pages to get along with Hugo.2 For this website, I have a source repository where I make my edits and publish it to my website directory (lin-jennifer.github.io). You can use this system by adding publishDir = \u0026quot;../USERNAME.github.io\u0026quot; to your config.toml file, where USERNAME is your GitHub username. Unless you have a good reason for why you need the .Rmd, use standard .md files for posts. Additionally, Academic recomments that the .Rmarkdown file extension be used for anything with R content in lieu of .Rmd. When inserting things, it is probably easier to use Hugo shortcodes and Academic-specific shortcodes rather than standard Markdown methods of inserting images, videos, embeds and others. If you do use standard Markdown syntax, especially for images, place the content in the static/ folder. Patience. Your site won\u0026rsquo;t update immediately after update.sh tells you that it has been pushed to GitHub. It will take a hot minute\u0026hellip;  Going Forward As I keep saying throughout this piece, there are many ways that one can use, create and edit Academic. If there is something that you know that would make editing and creating content easier, please let me know!\n  All this could be done using point-and-click in R Studio as well. Simply go to File → New Project → New Directory → Website using Blogdown and select the options that you want, including gcushen/hugo-academic in the theme field to signal Academic as your theme. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Hugo provides some guidence on some different ways to deploy to GitHub Pages here. However, the two repository system is what I see some users use and what I find to be the most straightforward. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1588464000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593272800,"objectID":"f96957020ac9148787d6643d78a12610","permalink":"https://lin-jennifer.github.io/post/websites-using-academic/","publishdate":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/websites-using-academic/","section":"post","summary":"A laundry list of some Hugo Academic tips that I (still) find useful.","tags":["R","Websites"],"title":"Websites using Academic","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Code"],"content":"The poster template is based off the UW\u0026ndash;Madison Poster on Overleaf.\nDemo The outcome of the poster can be seen here: https://github.com/lin-jennifer/NCFPoster/blob/master/main.pdf\nUsing this Template The best way to use this template is to clone the GitHub repositiory in the link at the top of the post or here\nIf you choose to delete some of the demo objects in the file in favor of your own materials, be sure to include the following items\n main.tex: The root file that contains the temaplate for the poster seen in the demo.

The focus of this study is on the causal link between descriptive peer norms and intergroup attitudes and intentions. For this project, we compared a negative descriptive norm about a high prevalence of discriminatory behavior among peers to a positive descriptive norm of pro-diversity attitudes among peers (a control condition is also included). The study recruited participants (n = 89) from Amazon Mechanical Turk where each participant was paid \\$0.40 for their participation. Participants were asked to complete two separate surveys. The first survey made salient the descriptive social norms for either the negative descriptive norms condition, positive descriptive norms condition, or the control condition using a data interpretation activity. The second survey consisted of four self-report Likert scale items that measured intergroup anxiety, concern about discrimination, tolerance of racism, and behavioral intentions. This survey also included a manipulation check that measured perceptions of peer norms regarding discrimination and inclusivity. To assess whether participants were engaged in the data interpretation activity, content analyses on the responses to the interpretation questions were conducted. Linear models were constructed in R to assess the relationship between norm condition and each of the outcome measures. The results show that while most individuals do engage in the data interpretation task and demonstrate an understanding of the normative information that the data imply, there was no influence of the descriptive peer norms information on norm-conforming intergroup attitudes and behavioral intentions.","tags":[],"title":"What It Is and What We Can Be$:$ Using Social Norms to Influence Intergroup Attitudes and Behaviors","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jack Reilly","Jack Belk","Annika Kufrovich","Jennifer Lin","Rory Renzy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592259954,"objectID":"29f101a0b17cf0784706e080adff2234","permalink":"https://lin-jennifer.github.io/publication/fl18vote/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fl18vote/","section":"publication","summary":"An analysis of the vote shares in Florida for the 2018 Midterm elections using the Florida Voter File.","tags":["Florida","Elections"],"title":"Scott, Nelson, DeSantis, Gillum \u0026 Beyond$:$ A Look at 2018 Florida Precinct Returns","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Todd Makse","Jennifer Lin","Anand Sokhey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554548400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589312215,"objectID":"5a829182a685fea8bfaf6b5b56156bc6","permalink":"https://lin-jennifer.github.io/talk/levels/","publishdate":"2019-04-06T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/levels/","section":"talk","summary":"Drawing on the levels of conceptualization typology from The American Voter, we examine the relationship between perceptions of how discussion partners think about politics and whether they are perceived as politically knowledgeable.","tags":[],"title":"Levels of Conceptualization and Perceptions of Sophistication in Political Discourse","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jennifer Lin","Steven M.

The majority of Americans go to church and affiliate with some type of faith throughout their lives. Recently, there is also a rise in the use of churches as polling locations. While the intention is not to mix the notions of church and state, this raises the question of potential influences of religion on political behavior. In this research project, I aim to understand if priming of religion, as exemplified by voting in a church, would lead to more conservative voting behaviors. Through a survey design with 304 participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk, this research primes participants to think about religion and asks them to rate their agreement with a vignette that presents an argument on abortion. The results suggest that the argument was more impactful in swaying people’s decisions, and not the religious prime itself. A possible reason for this is the saliency of the prime. As the prime was not as salient as voting in a church, this may not create the effect that the study aimed to test. For further research, it is useful to make more salient primes as a way to test the interaction of religion and conservative political behavior.","tags":[],"title":"Will God's Grace Guide My Vote?","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Dino P.

While citizens cannot reasonably expect that representatives will cater to their particular interests or priorities all the time, we know little about citizens’ expectations in this regard. In this paper, we present the results of two survey experiments that probe the relationship between citizens’ group identifications, their perceptions of their constituencies, and their demands regarding representation. We find that citizens are generally egocentric, in that they expect a representative to cater to personally relevant interests even when such interests are not an important part of the representative’s constituency. Moreover, we find that this egocentrism is not mitigated through the provision of information about the district’s diversity or composition, indicating that voter ignorance about the nature of constituencies is not the primary cause of these expectations.
