      <title>Applying to Graduate School</title>
      <link>https://lin-jennifer.github.io/post/applying-to-graduate-school/</link>

      <guid>https://lin-jennifer.github.io/post/applying-to-graduate-school/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I applied to 12 Political Science Ph.D. programs during my senior year as an undergraduate student, most of them in the Midwest, and I got accepted to 7 of them. This process, especially as a first-generation college student, was challenging for me. Fortunately, I had great mentors in the process&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I wanted to take this opportunity to discuss some of the experiences that I had, things that worked for me, and opportunities that aspiring graduate students can take advantage of in their journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post assumes that you have already determined which programs that you are going to apply to. For Political Science, most applications entail applying to the department, which means that learning about the opportunities and work that current faculty and graduate students there do can be a good place to start compiling the list of programs. In picking programs, approach this with purpose &amp;ndash; think about some reach programs, some target and some safety that might work for you. It can also help to know the network of your &lt;a href=&#34;#LOR&#34;&gt;letter writers&lt;/a&gt; and use that to inform your search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I am not a professional advisor for graduate school application. I am largely speaking for my experience going through this process with reasonable success&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;contents&#34;&gt;Contents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Main&#34;&gt;Main Components&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#GRE&#34;&gt;The GRE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#GPA&#34;&gt;Transcripts and GPA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#WS&#34;&gt;Writing Sample&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#CV&#34;&gt;CV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#LOR&#34;&gt;Letters of Recommendation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#SOP&#34;&gt;Statement of Purpose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#OMS&#34;&gt;Opportunities for Minority Students&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Fee&#34;&gt;Application Fee Waiver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Visit&#34;&gt;Diversity Visit Weekends&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;Main&#34;&gt;Components of the Graduate Application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the program, there may be some differences in the exact requirements of the application. However, there are 6 main sections that generally apply across most Ph.D. applications, certainly in Political Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;GRE&#34;&gt;The GRE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My best advice: take it once &lt;em&gt;when you feel confident and ready&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a 4 hour computer-based test and costs $205 &amp;ndash; In other words, it is long, expensive and an experience that is best when had only once. I recognize that, by saying this, it assumes that you have the luxury of time to choose when it is best for you to test. Since you can test anytime until mid-November of Fall semester, which is basically 3 weeks before most applications are due, it is possible that you might be in a situation where you just have to do it to get the best possible score for this cycle&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to be clear, I &lt;strong&gt;do not&lt;/strong&gt; recommend waiting until the last mintue to test. Many people have told me that testing during Spring or Summer of your junior year may be a good option. When considering when you should take your GRE, look at your calendar and ballpark a date. Unlike the SATs and ACTs for high school, GRE test slots are available almost every day of the week with many places near you that can administer the test.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As a result, it is up to you to plan for a time that is most comfortable and a time you feel most prepared to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparing for the Test&lt;/strong&gt;: Other than planning on when/where to take the test, I highly recomment preparing for the test itself. On social media, I have seen numerous advice boards where people say that, if you are good in English or math, you can just test without a problem. Even if you are a math geek or have an broad vocabulary, I still recommend going through a practice guide to work out the problems and taking a few practice tests using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/powerprep/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;PowerPrep Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which is ETS&amp;rsquo;s test similator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing with Accommodations&lt;/strong&gt;: If you have ADA accommodations through your college/workplace, I highly recommend applying them for the GRE. To apply, consult the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/register/disabilities&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Accommodations for Test Takers with Disabilities or Health-related Needs&lt;/a&gt; for more information. As the page suggests, this process takes some time, which means that it would require more planning on your end to detwemine when you want to take the test and submit documentation with ample time to ensure that everything gets processed in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;GPA&#34;&gt;Transcripts and GPA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each graduate program has different requirements for how to submit a transcript. Most of them require a scan of an official transcript and only want sealed copies once you confirm that you are attending their program. Others might require mailed copies in the application process and still others might ask for a sealed copy in order to send you an acceptance letter. Understanding the transcript requirements early on can save you some money in the process. I recommend reading through the requirements for all your programs to best plan for when to order, the number of copies to order, and where to send them. By default, you should plan to order one scan copy for all the applications and add to reflect the differences in application requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schools without GPAs&lt;/strong&gt;: If you attend a college without a GPA, as I did, reach out to the Director of Graduate Studies (DGS) or Graduate Coordinator of your intended program(s) and ask about how you should go about filling out the GPA field. In your email, you should also ask about how you can submit any documents that reflect course performance. In my case, it was narrative evaluations that, fortunately, were part of my transcript so I sent a massive file with all of those documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;WS&#34;&gt;Writing Sample&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Writing Sample is your opportunity to demonstrate competence in research skills. When selecting your sample, consider a piece that accurately captures your research interests and showcases your ability to collect data, run analyses, and communicate your findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advice that I got in this step was to take care of each section because you would not know which section the admissions committee would read. They might read the entire paper, they might read a section, they might skim &amp;ndash; either way, it is not a document where you want typos hanging around. In other words, if you are submitting a final paper from a class last year, be sure to still read it over before submitting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference, &lt;a href=&#34;https://lin-jennifer.github.io/talk/moraltext/MoralText.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here is my writing sample&lt;/a&gt;. It was a shortened version of the fourth chapter of my honors thesis. In my case, I might say that my writing sample helped get me into some of my programs as professors who I wanted to work with emailed me to tell me how they liked my sample and how it aligned with projects that they wanted to do. My point in mentioning this is to say that you should not simply select &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; paper to submit, but to think carefully about the research that you are trying to do in graduate school and have this paper be a reflection of those goals. This paper should, ideally, also demonstrate the potential that you have to the learn and apply some of the core research and statistical methods that you would need in your career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;CV&#34;&gt;CV/Resume&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your CV/Resume is your opportunity to showcase your experiences in and out of academia. While some of these experiences, most notably those related to research projects or teaching experiences, will be on your statement of purpose, activities that demonstrate transferable skills such as public speaking or leadership in clubs/sports might not be on the statement. That is why your CV is an important part of your application &amp;ndash; it helps to demonstrate your achievements but also show the diverse experiences that you had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, while your CV is a good place to describe campus jobs or co-curricular activities, it can also help make your case as a researcher to use the descriptions to demonstrate experience and competence with research, time-management, organization and communication related skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quasi-templated my own CV that I used in my application to demonstrate possible sections that can be used in your own CV. It is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.overleaf.com/read/fmpwssrwrjsr&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here on Overleaf&lt;/a&gt; in $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$ format. The PDF should be available for download and the format is easy to emulate in Word. For $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$ users, you are welcome to make a copy of the code and work off that copy for your resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your CV is also a document that would take time and revisions. I highly recommend consulting a career coach in your career center or a professor for advice on ways to refine your CV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;LOR&#34;&gt;Letters of Recommendation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letter of Recommendations are opportunities for others to make an impression on your behalf. Most applications will require 3 professional references from professors, supervisors, or other professional references &amp;ndash; in other words, not family or friends. For research-based Ph.D. programs, I recommend selecting recommenders who you know in either a research or teaching experience. This might be a Primary Investigator (PI) in a lab that you worked in or an instructor for a class that you were a Teaching Assistant (TA). They should know you fairly well and agree to write a good letter for your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about your letter writers early and let them know that you are interested in asking them for a letter for graduate applications as early in the process as possible. As soon as you know which programs you are applying to, let your letter writers know of the deadlines and send them information on how to submit their letters. They might ask you to provide them with your application materials, so be sure to send that information to them in a timely manner so that they have ample time to prepare their letters (spproxinately 3-4 weeks before the deadline).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you hear back from your programs, be sure to let your letter writers know the results regardless of whether or not you were accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;SOP&#34;&gt;Statement of Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you google &amp;ldquo;How to write a (good) Statement of Purpose for graduate school&amp;rdquo; (or something to that effect), you will largely get blog posts or lists of ways to write a &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; statement of purpose, or a list of things &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do. The reason for this is that there is not necessarily a hard-and-fast recipe for writing a good statement of purpose but there are certainly many ways that you can do it wrong. When writing your statement of purpose, look at some of those! To put it quite bluntly, it is better for the internet to warn you in their list of don&amp;rsquo;ts than to be rejected from a program for these mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reading your application requirements, many of them will just have a place to upload a statement of purpose without much else in terms of directions. However, some departments will specify what they want to see in terms of content, word count or page limits. Be sure to research these requirements and keep time in mind as you write you statement of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a general statement of purpose, it is best o limit it to 2 pages. Some good things to discuss in your statement can include any research plans that you have, career goals, past research experience, and why you want to attend graduate school, especially in the particular program in which you are applying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of writing the statement of purpose, it is helpful to get several people to review and revise your statement. It is a part of your application that may require the most time. Revising the statement with different input can help strengthen your writing, catch typos and provide insight on things to add or change. I recommend seeking a diverse group of people who might know you in different contexts to help with different components of the statement. Having a friend who knows your background or an advisor who knows your research look over your statement allows them to provide you with insight on how you can add or change pieces to put your best foot forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;OMS&#34;&gt;Opportunities for Minority Students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen posts on Twitter and Facebook numerous times about how higher education inherently gives an edge to wealthy white individuals and application fees make this endeavor inaccessible for low income students. There are some things colleges/universities are doing to address the problem and this may help you in your application if you qualify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;Fee&#34;&gt;Application Fee Waivers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a member of an undergraduate research program for minorities such as McNair or SROP, or if you receive a Pell Grant from your FAFSA, you can qualify for application fee waivers to most of your programs. Be sure to look into these early on. Some schools are specific in how you can acquire a waiver and they might require additional materials in order to secure this waiver. You can often find instructions by simply conducting a google search of &amp;ldquo;[SCHOOL NAME] Graduate Application Fee Waiver&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;Visit&#34;&gt;Diversity Visit Weekends&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some graduate schools also conduct diversity visit weekends. These are often full expense paid trips to visit a graduate program for a weekend &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the application is due. To qualify for these, you would need to be from a diverse background as defined by the program. These opportunities allow you to network with members from the department that you are applying to, learn more about the application process and about graudate school in general, and provide you an opportunity to ask questions. These opportunities often come with application waivers to the school itself. Since most of these are in the Fall, applications are often opened and due in the summer beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some possible opportunities &amp;ndash; some of these are general, some are specific to Political Science. Please know that this is not an end-all list. In fact, I welcome contributions. Please &lt;a href=&#34;https://lin-jennifer.github.io/#contact&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;write to me&lt;/a&gt; if you know of any opportunities that fit this criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When testing so last minute, think about whether it is necessary. It is best to plan for the GRE well in advance of your graduate applications.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Websites using Academic</title>
      <link>https://lin-jennifer.github.io/post/websites-using-academic/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://lin-jennifer.github.io/post/websites-using-academic/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Academic theme on Hugo&lt;/a&gt; is quite a popular theme for people, especially academics to use to create their own websites, be it for a lab or as a personal portfolio page, like this one. And this is for a good reason. &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Academic&lt;/a&gt; is quite easy to use and it is very flexible to the needs of the user, allowing creators to design web pages using a variety of widgets and even allowing them to create some new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, you may ask, why are you writing this post? Well, as the title suggests, there were a few things I learned that I wanted to document for my future self and for those wishing to pick this theme up. Many users have also done something similar, with great examples being from &lt;a href=&#34;https://georgecushen.com/create-your-website-with-hugo/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;George Cushen, the creator of Academic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://alison.rbind.io/post/2019-02-21-hugo-page-bundles/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Allison Hill, a coauthor on Blogdown&lt;/a&gt;. I should note that this post is not necessarily geared towards a setp-by-step on how to create a website using Hugo themes, as those tips are documented by the creators of the themes themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-wish-i-knew&#34;&gt;What I Wish I Knew&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s begin with the second question because I think it is more straightforward and something that people who want to use this theme should know &amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;Academic is so simple, yet complex&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the amount of documentation that Academic and their community of users provide on the internet, it is easy to understand the &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; component. Academic relies on Markdown, or R Markdown if you would prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, the more complicated part comes with the organization of the site, which, for beginners, may come with a learning curve. I created my site using &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Blogdown&lt;/a&gt;, but there are many ways that one can use to create and deploy an Academic site. But regardless of what you end up choosing, the first few hours, maybe days, would be dedicated to you constantly asking yourself: &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Where is that file?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; The &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Blogdown book&lt;/a&gt;, which I recommend looking through if you choose Blogdown, suggests a 10 minute curve for users not familiar with code in CSS or JavaScript, but my personal experience showed that it took a lot longer for me to get accustomed to the site and framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the good news is that once you get over the learning curve, it is quite easy to edit and innovate your Academic site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-learned&#34;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note that this list was based on the structure of Version 4.9. I will continue to update this list as I learn more&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I discussed earlier, there can be a learning curve to the site. In the rest of this post, I will attempt to document all the tips I found handy in my process of getting accustomed to the site. In this process, I assume that you are using Blogdown and have &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;read the book&lt;/a&gt; to know how to &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/other-themes.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;initiate an Academic site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming you don&amp;rsquo;t already know Markdown, learn some basic syntax. Academic&amp;rsquo;s documentation provides a &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;great guide to do this&lt;/a&gt;. It also helps to have a general understanding of HTML syntax as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bookmark some cheat sheets. I recommend:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&amp;amp;s=regular,solid&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Font Awesome general (fas)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&amp;amp;s=brands&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Font Awesome Brand (fab)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Academicons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Emojis Cheatsheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.toptal.com/designers/htmlarrows/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;HTML Symbols Cheatsheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build your site often to see if there are errors. I recommend using the &lt;code&gt;blogdown:::serve_site()&lt;/code&gt; command, which, if you use R Studio, generates a preview in a viewer tab in your screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regardless of the approach you use to create and edit your site, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO NOT TOUCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;code&gt;themes/&lt;/code&gt; folder in your site source. You can mirror the file structure under the &lt;code&gt;themes/&lt;/code&gt; folder to create your own content, as &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/page-builder/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;explained here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When building with Blogdown and deplaying to GitHub pages, I recommend using a two repository system where one serves as the &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; and the other is the publish directory. This is because there are some challenges for GitHub pages to get along with Hugo.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For this website, I have a source repository where I make my edits and publish it to my website directory (&lt;code&gt;lin-jennifer.github.io&lt;/code&gt;). You can use this system by adding &lt;code&gt;publishDir = &amp;quot;../USERNAME.github.io&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; to your &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; file, where &lt;code&gt;USERNAME&lt;/code&gt; is your GitHub username.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unless you have a good reason for why you need the &lt;code&gt;.Rmd&lt;/code&gt;, use standard &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; files for posts. Additionally, Academic &lt;strong&gt;recomments that the &lt;code&gt;.Rmarkdown&lt;/code&gt; file extension be used for anything with R content&lt;/strong&gt; in lieu of &lt;code&gt;.Rmd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When inserting things, it is probably easier to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hugo shortcodes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/#icons&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Academic-specific shortcodes&lt;/a&gt; rather than standard Markdown methods of inserting images, videos, embeds and others. If you do use standard Markdown syntax, especially for images, place the content in the &lt;code&gt;static/&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patience.&lt;/strong&gt; Your site won&amp;rsquo;t update immediately after &lt;code&gt;update.sh&lt;/code&gt; tells you that it has been pushed to GitHub. It will take a hot minute&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;going-forward&#34;&gt;Going Forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I keep saying throughout this piece, there are many ways that one can use, create and edit Academic. If there is something that you know that would make editing and creating content easier, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://lin-jennifer.github.io/#contact&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this could be done using point-and-click in R Studio as well. Simply go to &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; â &lt;code&gt;New Project&lt;/code&gt; â &lt;code&gt;New Directory&lt;/code&gt; â &lt;code&gt;Website using Blogdown&lt;/code&gt; and select the options that you want, including &lt;code&gt;gcushen/hugo-academic&lt;/code&gt; in the theme field to signal Academic as your theme.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo provides some guidence on some different ways to deploy to GitHub Pages &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. However, the two repository system is what I see some users use and what I find to be the most straightforward.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
