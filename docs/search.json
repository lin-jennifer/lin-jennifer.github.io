    "text": "I study American Politics with an edge towards International Relations. I largely focus on the role of one’s socialization, context, and social networks in shaping political attitudes and behaviors. My research can be encapsulated in several broad categories as displayed in the Contents on the right. I go into greater detail in each section below. I also include publications, working papers and information on the trajectory for future work in this area.\nMy research has been generously funded by the Institute for Humane Studies at George Mason University and the Department of Political Science at Northwestern University."

    "text": "Dissertation Project\nMy dissertation is a book project that examines the role of the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) and service academy programs in shaping students’ political and social attitudes compared to civilian students who do not undergo this training. In addition, I examine how the public views ROTC programs and how such confidence in ROTC translates to broader support for the US military. In short, I ask three main questions:\n\nHow do the political and social attitudes of students in a military officer training program (like ROTC or service academy) compare to their civilian counterparts?\nHow do these attitudes develop across the course of the college career?\nHow does the public perceive these programs and how does it correlate with their attitudes about the American military?"
