My name is Jennifer Lin. I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of Political Science at Northwestern University and an incoming Assistant Professor at Rollins College. Broadly, my research interests are in American Politics and International Relations. I study civil-military relations, military professionalism, urban-rural politics, public opinion, social networks and political engagement. My research has appeared in the *American Journal of Political Science*, *British Journal of Political Science*, *Public Opinion Quarterly*, *Political Research Quarterly*, *Political Science Research and Methods*, *American Politics Research*, and *Journal of American Medical Association -- Network Open*.

Beyond my research, I am passionate about teaching and mentoring students. I am interested and prepared to teach classes in American politics, research design and quantitative methods, including surveys, experiments, and computational methods in R.

I earned my Bachelors of Arts (BA) with Honors in Psychology and Political Science from New College of Florida.
