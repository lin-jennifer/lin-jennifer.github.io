&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;./1_Overview_Notes.pdf&#34;&gt;Week 1 Handout (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;political-science-is-a-science&#34;&gt;Political Science is a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCIENCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political Science is a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and so the study of politics (Political Science) follows many of the steps any scientist (be it a Biologist, Chemist, Physicist) would follow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask Questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do Research and Formulate a theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make Predictions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test Predictions with Data and Experiments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run statics and report results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share findings with the world!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Political Science, we try to model political space by asking questions and finding answers. However, models do not cover everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about models in your life. What comes to mind? Maybe toy cars, blueprints, maps, globes? Each of these try to model something of interest. Specifically, a car, a house (or whatever it is intending to build), streets in a city, and the world. Yet, each model is missing something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about a model of a house. If you are a plumber, you might only care about where the pipes are. If you are an electrician, maybe how the electric grid runs. If you are a painter, you only want to know the square footage of the walls, and if you are an interior designer, maybe just the layout of the space. Inherently, if I asked each of these roles to draw a model of a house, I will get different results. This is because models only display some parts well but not others. A model of a house from an interior designer will mean almost nothing to a plumber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is political science at its core. Social Science research only covers some aspect of the world. Any one study or any one way of measuring a concept is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; wrong. It is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; missing something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take my research agenda as an example. I study rural political behavior. But it is a lot to write a paper on rural political behavior for the entire world. Therefore, it is only reasonable for me to break up the study of rural political behavior into several, more manageable question chunks. Here is a non-exhaustive list of more specific questions, where you can further break it down to even more specific questions if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is &amp;ldquo;rural&amp;rdquo; and how do we measure it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kinds of political behavior are we interested?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What perspective are we taking? (historical, recent elections, etc.?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;measurement&#34;&gt;Measurement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you want to model something in political science? What is the concept that you want to measure? What are some things we need to consider in thinking about how to measure this concept?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we are interested in measuring someone&amp;rsquo;s feelings towards a member of the opposing party. In thinking about a way to measure someone&amp;rsquo;s feelings towards a member of the opposing party, we need to hash out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we define &amp;ldquo;feelings&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;opposing party&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliability of the Measure &amp;ndash; same thing each time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Validity of the Measure &amp;ndash; measures what we are intending&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common way of measuring this concept is the feeling thermometer, where respondent rate, from a  0 to 100 scale, how warmly they feel towards members of their own or opposing party. But remember, all models are wrong! WHat does this measurement not assess? Perhaps trust? Intent to socialize? Belonging? All of these are valid and researchers have developed items to measure feelings towards opposing partisans to address each of these concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week 2$:$ Descriptive Statistics and Causality</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;handout&#34;&gt;Handout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;./2_Descriptives_Notes.pdf&#34;&gt;Week 2 Handout (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: For all images, please refer to the PDF file above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;descriptive-statistics&#34;&gt;Descriptive Statistics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we have data, we want to know what our data look like and what story it tells. The most simple way to quickly glance at our data is using &lt;strong&gt;descriptive statistics&lt;/strong&gt; such as the mean, median and mode concepts we came to love since elementary school. These statistics are simple models of our data. But before calculating any means, medians or modes, it is important to consider the way we constructed the measurements so we know how to best build our model, however simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we want to model ice cream tastes of students at Northwestern. We can do this in many ways. Here are three very simple ways. To illustrate the examples that follow, I constructed a simple data set that we will use to follow along. This data set includes a hypothetical sample of 100 Northwestern Wildcats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nominal-scales&#34;&gt;Nominal Scales&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nominal scales&lt;/strong&gt; are categorical. In survey questions, they represent items that sort into categories, often descriptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is your favorite ice cream flavor?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chocolate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vanilla&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mint Chocolate Chip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strawberry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data are often described using a bar graph or a pie chart. Given the small number of categories, you are likely better off just summarizing them in a table. Nonetheless, here is a bar graph of our results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ordinal-scales&#34;&gt;Ordinal Scales&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of &lt;strong&gt;ordinal scales&lt;/strong&gt;, we are interested in questions that generate an ordered scale as the response options. These can include items such as &amp;ldquo;From a scale of 0 - 10, how much do you like ice cream?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Do you agree or disagree with the notion that ice cream is a good desert?&amp;rdquo; For our ice cream example, here is a question to consider. The options range from &amp;ldquo;Strongly disagree&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Strongly agree&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you agree or disagree with the fact that Vanilla Ice Cream is your favorite ice cream flavor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strongly Disagree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disagree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neither Agree nor Disagree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strongly Agree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can summarize these results in a similar way that we did the nominal results. Alternatively, we can cover them to numbers and generate means and medians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;interval-scales&#34;&gt;Interval Scales&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;Interval Scales&lt;/strong&gt; are scales that use a numeric interval in the response options. Often, these have a meaningful zero and the numbers are evenly spaced apart. When you ask your friend what the temperature is outside, they likely will give you a number on the Celsius or Fahrenheit scales that both have meaningful zeros^[I guess the Celsius more so than Fahrenheit since $0^{\circ}\text{C}$ is the freezing point of water.]. When you buy something, the cashier would measure the amount you owe in dollars and cents, where there is also a meaningful zero. In our ice cream study, we can consider the following question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How many scoops of ice cream do you eat each day?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of the graphs, we can better understand our data with means and medians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-causality&#34;&gt;Introduction to Causality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-basics&#34;&gt;The Basics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a hot summer day, we can reasonably expect ourselves to become dehydrated, or our ice cream to melt almost instantly. Here, we are able to pinpoint direct causes of effects that we want to observe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, social science is not always as straightforward. If a tree fell in the woods, and no one was there to witness it, (a) do we know it fell and (b) can we reasonably make suggestions as to how it fell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Causal inference is about pinpointing, with &lt;em&gt;pretty good&lt;/em&gt; certainty, how the tree fell. It is drawing a direct relationship between two variables X and Y. Notice the emphasis on &lt;em&gt;pretty good&lt;/em&gt;. This is because we cannot gain a full sense of cause in social science research, due to the error or noise that is bound to arise in human behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s turn to a case study on voting. Why do people go vote? Can it be based on any of the following?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest in politics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of the candidates and issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desire to make a change in the community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tagging along with friends and family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, can any of these be an effect of voting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-four-questions&#34;&gt;The Four Questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using our voting example, let&amp;rsquo;s focus on the &amp;ldquo;Desire to make change in the community&amp;rdquo; aspect. Can this desire lead people to vote?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a relationship between X and Y?&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; For voting, sure! Desires to make change leads to voting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could Y cause X?&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Can voting lead to greater desires to make change? Likely, since you now began a journey of political engagement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a causal pathway from X to Y?&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Likely, if we design a model to isolate the correct variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could there be confounding variables?&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; OH&amp;hellip; ABSOLUTELY!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;experiments&#34;&gt;Experiments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiments are one of the best ways to identify causal mechanisms. You create two comparable groups using random assignment, give one group the treatment and another no treatment. Now, the only difference between the groups is the treatment, since both groups are, in theory, comparable (or the same).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
Y_{i, T} \ = \ \text{Treatment}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
Y_{i, C} \ = \ \text{Control}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\text{Causal Effect} \ = \ Y_{i, T} - Y_{i, C}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we want to know whether &lt;strong&gt;desire to effect change&lt;/strong&gt; in society really causes &lt;strong&gt;voter turnout&lt;/strong&gt;. We con conduct an experiment using the following conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$Y_{i, T}$: Prime Desire to Effect Change in society by telling people about things in their neighborhood that need to change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$Y_{i, C}$: Control message &amp;ndash; Recycling is good for the planet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a desire to effect change causes turnout, then the treatment conditions will see a higher turnout rate than the control condition.&lt;/p&gt;
