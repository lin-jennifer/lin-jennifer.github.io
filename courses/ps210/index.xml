&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;./1_Overview_Notes.pdf&#34;&gt;Week 1 Handout (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;political-science-is-a-science&#34;&gt;Political Science is a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCIENCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political Science is a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and so the study of politics (Political Science) follows many of the steps any scientist (be it a Biologist, Chemist, Physicist) would follow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask Questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do Research and Formulate a theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make Predictions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test Predictions with Data and Experiments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run statics and report results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share findings with the world!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Political Science, we try to model political space by asking questions and finding answers. However, models do not cover everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about models in your life. What comes to mind? Maybe toy cars, blueprints, maps, globes? Each of these try to model something of interest. Specifically, a car, a house (or whatever it is intending to build), streets in a city, and the world. Yet, each model is missing something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about a model of a house. If you are a plumber, you might only care about where the pipes are. If you are an electrician, maybe how the electric grid runs. If you are a painter, you only want to know the square footage of the walls, and if you are an interior designer, maybe just the layout of the space. Inherently, if I asked each of these roles to draw a model of a house, I will get different results. This is because models only display some parts well but not others. A model of a house from an interior designer will mean almost nothing to a plumber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is political science at its core. Social Science research only covers some aspect of the world. Any one study or any one way of measuring a concept is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; wrong. It is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; missing something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take my research agenda as an example. I study rural political behavior. But it is a lot to write a paper on rural political behavior for the entire world. Therefore, it is only reasonable for me to break up the study of rural political behavior into several, more manageable question chunks. Here is a non-exhaustive list of more specific questions, where you can further break it down to even more specific questions if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is &amp;ldquo;rural&amp;rdquo; and how do we measure it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kinds of political behavior are we interested?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What perspective are we taking? (historical, recent elections, etc.?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;measurement&#34;&gt;Measurement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you want to model something in political science? What is the concept that you want to measure? What are some things we need to consider in thinking about how to measure this concept?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we are interested in measuring someone&amp;rsquo;s feelings towards a member of the opposing party. In thinking about a way to measure someone&amp;rsquo;s feelings towards a member of the opposing party, we need to hash out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we define &amp;ldquo;feelings&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;opposing party&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliability of the Measure &amp;ndash; same thing each time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Validity of the Measure &amp;ndash; measures what we are intending&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common way of measuring this concept is the feeling thermometer, where respondent rate, from a  0 to 100 scale, how warmly they feel towards members of their own or opposing party. But remember, all models are wrong! WHat does this measurement not assess? Perhaps trust? Intent to socialize? Belonging? All of these are valid and researchers have developed items to measure feelings towards opposing partisans to address each of these concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week 2$:$ Descriptive Statistics and Causality</title>
      <link>https://lin-jennifer.github.io/courses/ps210/week2/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;handout&#34;&gt;Handout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;./2_Descriptives_Notes.pdf&#34;&gt;Week 2 Handout (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: For all images, please refer to the PDF file above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;descriptive-statistics&#34;&gt;Descriptive Statistics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we have data, we want to know what our data look like and what story it tells. The most simple way to quickly glance at our data is using &lt;strong&gt;descriptive statistics&lt;/strong&gt; such as the mean, median and mode concepts we came to love since elementary school. These statistics are simple models of our data. But before calculating any means, medians or modes, it is important to consider the way we constructed the measurements so we know how to best build our model, however simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we want to model ice cream tastes of students at Northwestern. We can do this in many ways. Here are three very simple ways. To illustrate the examples that follow, I constructed a simple data set that we will use to follow along. This data set includes a hypothetical sample of 100 Northwestern Wildcats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nominal-scales&#34;&gt;Nominal Scales&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nominal scales&lt;/strong&gt; are categorical. In survey questions, they represent items that sort into categories, often descriptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is your favorite ice cream flavor?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chocolate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vanilla&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mint Chocolate Chip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strawberry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data are often described using a bar graph or a pie chart. Given the small number of categories, you are likely better off just summarizing them in a table. Nonetheless, here is a bar graph of our results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ordinal-scales&#34;&gt;Ordinal Scales&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of &lt;strong&gt;ordinal scales&lt;/strong&gt;, we are interested in questions that generate an ordered scale as the response options. These can include items such as &amp;ldquo;From a scale of 0 - 10, how much do you like ice cream?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Do you agree or disagree with the notion that ice cream is a good desert?&amp;rdquo; For our ice cream example, here is a question to consider. The options range from &amp;ldquo;Strongly disagree&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Strongly agree&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you agree or disagree with the fact that Vanilla Ice Cream is your favorite ice cream flavor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strongly Disagree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disagree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neither Agree nor Disagree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strongly Agree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can summarize these results in a similar way that we did the nominal results. Alternatively, we can cover them to numbers and generate means and medians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;interval-scales&#34;&gt;Interval Scales&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;Interval Scales&lt;/strong&gt; are scales that use a numeric interval in the response options. Often, these have a meaningful zero and the numbers are evenly spaced apart. When you ask your friend what the temperature is outside, they likely will give you a number on the Celsius or Fahrenheit scales that both have meaningful zeros^[I guess the Celsius more so than Fahrenheit since $0^{\circ}\text{C}$ is the freezing point of water.]. When you buy something, the cashier would measure the amount you owe in dollars and cents, where there is also a meaningful zero. In our ice cream study, we can consider the following question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How many scoops of ice cream do you eat each day?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of the graphs, we can better understand our data with means and medians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-causality&#34;&gt;Introduction to Causality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-basics&#34;&gt;The Basics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a hot summer day, we can reasonably expect ourselves to become dehydrated, or our ice cream to melt almost instantly. Here, we are able to pinpoint direct causes of effects that we want to observe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, social science is not always as straightforward. If a tree fell in the woods, and no one was there to witness it, (a) do we know it fell and (b) can we reasonably make suggestions as to how it fell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Causal inference is about pinpointing, with &lt;em&gt;pretty good&lt;/em&gt; certainty, how the tree fell. It is drawing a direct relationship between two variables X and Y. Notice the emphasis on &lt;em&gt;pretty good&lt;/em&gt;. This is because we cannot gain a full sense of cause in social science research, due to the error or noise that is bound to arise in human behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s turn to a case study on voting. Why do people go vote? Can it be based on any of the following?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest in politics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of the candidates and issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desire to make a change in the community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tagging along with friends and family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, can any of these be an effect of voting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-four-questions&#34;&gt;The Four Questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using our voting example, let&amp;rsquo;s focus on the &amp;ldquo;Desire to make change in the community&amp;rdquo; aspect. Can this desire lead people to vote?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a relationship between X and Y?&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; For voting, sure! Desires to make change leads to voting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could Y cause X?&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Can voting lead to greater desires to make change? Likely, since you now began a journey of political engagement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a causal pathway from X to Y?&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Likely, if we design a model to isolate the correct variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could there be confounding variables?&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; OH&amp;hellip; ABSOLUTELY!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;experiments&#34;&gt;Experiments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiments are one of the best ways to identify causal mechanisms. You create two comparable groups using random assignment, give one group the treatment and another no treatment. Now, the only difference between the groups is the treatment, since both groups are, in theory, comparable (or the same).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
Y_{i, T} \ = \ \text{Treatment}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
Y_{i, C} \ = \ \text{Control}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\text{Causal Effect} \ = \ Y_{i, T} - Y_{i, C}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we want to know whether &lt;strong&gt;desire to effect change&lt;/strong&gt; in society really causes &lt;strong&gt;voter turnout&lt;/strong&gt;. We con conduct an experiment using the following conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$Y_{i, T}$: Prime Desire to Effect Change in society by telling people about things in their neighborhood that need to change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$Y_{i, C}$: Control message &amp;ndash; Recycling is good for the planet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a desire to effect change causes turnout, then the treatment conditions will see a higher turnout rate than the control condition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week 3$:$ Sampling and Surveys</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;handout&#34;&gt;Handout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;./3_Sampling_Notes.pdf&#34;&gt;Week 3 Handout (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-you-want-to-conduct-a-survey&#34;&gt;So you want to Conduct a Survey?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-you-need&#34;&gt;What you need&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run a good survey, you need some of the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;RANDOM&lt;/strong&gt; Sample&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good Survey Questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skills to analyze survey data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we will focus on the &lt;strong&gt;Random&lt;/strong&gt; Sample component&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-random-what-is-a-sample&#34;&gt;What is Random? What is a Sample?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, what is a &lt;strong&gt;sample&lt;/strong&gt;? To figure that out, we need to know what is part of the &lt;strong&gt;population&lt;/strong&gt;, or the entire entity of the thing that we are interested in studying. Individuals or single unites in the population constitute our &lt;strong&gt;unit of analysis&lt;/strong&gt;. This can be people (a person), states (a state), or households (house).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When designing a study, your &lt;strong&gt;sample&lt;/strong&gt; is a selection of the units in the population and it should resemble the entire group of interest. There are many ways to pick a sample and there are positives and negatives of each method&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sampling of Convenience&lt;/strong&gt;: Select cases that are easily accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. EXAMPLE: Stand outside of dining hall and interview everyone trying to go in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. EXAMPLE: Polls on FOX, CNN, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quota Samples&lt;/strong&gt; are where you modify the convenience sample to make it more like the population&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. This is also known as &lt;strong&gt;non-probability sampling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. This is often used in online survey marketplaces and Amazon Mechanical Turk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. EXAMPLE: The COVID States Project: &lt;a href=&#34;https://covidstates.org/&#34;&gt;https://covidstates.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;
- We want to know political attitudes and behaviors of people in each US State &lt;br&gt;
- We conduct online samples to get respondents from each US State &lt;br&gt;
- Each state has a quota of 300-500 per wave, depending on size.&lt;br&gt;
- Within each state, we do race, gender and age cross tabs so that each bucket gets a fix number equivalent to their percent in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Random Sampling&lt;/strong&gt; is where each case has an equal and known probability of being selected&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Also known as &lt;strong&gt;Probability Sampling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Often done by Random Digit Dialing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. EXAMPLE: Kaiser Family Foundation (Random Digit Dialing)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. &lt;strong&gt;Law of Large Numbers&lt;/strong&gt;: Random Sampling gives us a good approximation of the population with a large enough population&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e. Types of Random Samples:&lt;br&gt;
1. &lt;strong&gt;Simple Random Sample&lt;/strong&gt;: Each person has the same probability of being included.&lt;br&gt;
2. &lt;strong&gt;Cluster Sample&lt;/strong&gt;: Group participants into meaningful subgroups and select the subgroup to its entirety.&lt;br&gt;
3. &lt;strong&gt;Stratified Random Sampling&lt;/strong&gt;: Group participants into meaningful subgroups and select samples from the subgroup where EACH member of the subgroup has the same probability of selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;issues-with-surveys&#34;&gt;Issues with Surveys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surveys may have multiple issues related to measurements. For the sampling front, however, we are interested in issues with the sample recruitment. Some issues here might include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-response&lt;/strong&gt;: People selected for the survey just don&amp;rsquo;t want to engage with the survey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard to Reach Populations&lt;/strong&gt;: Some people who are selected for surveys might not be able to access the survey OR it can be hard to reach some people since they are difficult to identify.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some ways to address these issues. But to do this, we need to be creative with our sampling methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snowball Sampling&lt;/strong&gt;: Getting potential participants from current participants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respondent-driven Sampling&lt;/strong&gt;: Go where the participants are (or might be)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Week 4$:$ Surveys, Experiments, Midterms and More</title>
      <link>https://lin-jennifer.github.io/courses/ps210/week4/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;handout&#34;&gt;Handout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;./4_Review_NOTES.pdf&#34;&gt;Week 4 Handout (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;writing-a-good-survey-question&#34;&gt;Writing a Good Survey Question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surveys are often built to compare groups, describe something or analyze something. Survey questions are designed for you to be able to ask people about their attitudes and behaviors on certain topics. As such, people are self-reporting the information through the questions that you pose to them. Writing a good survey question can be rather difficult as you need to consider and ask about the who, what, when, where, why and how of the situation. There are so many things to think about and there are often space limitations so the struggle is getting the questions out and fitting it into the framework set by your resource limitations (i.e. time, length of the survey etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, when writing a survey question, there are few things that we need to think about. First, it is important for you to put yourself in the shoes of the participant. So how do participants answer survey questions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stage 0: Encode Information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stage 1: Understand all the words and what the question is asking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stage 2: Recall all information and figure out how to answer the question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stage 3: Assess initial answer for accuracy and completeness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stage 4: Report answer by mapping your answer to the options given&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of putting yourself in your participants&#39; shoes, you should also think about the difficulty of the question and whether the understand the issues that you are talking about. (For example, do not ask about an obscure TV show if you know they are likely not watching it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, your questions should address one thing per question. Therefore, if you are interested in cars, do not ask people if cars should be faster and more energy efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, questions that are simpler are better and they should not make assumptions of knowledge. Make sure wording is clear and the language is easy to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;experiments&#34;&gt;Experiments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;fundamental problem of causal inference&lt;/strong&gt; is that we canât compare a world with the cause to a world without the cause. Therefore, we use &lt;strong&gt;experiments&lt;/strong&gt; to solve this issue. In an experiment, we create two comparable groups using &lt;strong&gt;random assignment&lt;/strong&gt; and present one group with a treatment and another without. To be successful, the groups that result from random assignment should be relatively large and should reflect an independent selection process from the population, where each member had an equal chance of inclusion. This essentially creates a situation where we can study the treatment and control at the same time. There are several kinds of experiments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lab experiments&lt;/strong&gt;: Experiments are conducted in a lab or another controlled setting. For example, you can bring participants to the lab to test the effect of deliberation on political attitudes on various issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Field experiments&lt;/strong&gt;: Experiments are conducted in the natural environment but stimuli are controlled &amp;ndash; examples include going to neighborhoods and exposing people to treatments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natural experiments&lt;/strong&gt;: Taking advantage of a comparative scenario between at least two groups and letting that be the treatment and control and observe the effect. For example, if you wanted to compare the effect of an earthquake on happiness, you can conduct a natural experiment comparing two towns, one hit by an earthquake and one that did not and see how it affected feelings of the people there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Survey experiments&lt;/strong&gt;: Experiments that are done via surveys. The treatments are comparable to survey questions, but participants are often asked to read, listen, watch, write, or respond to some questions that serve as the treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In experiments, we are concerned with two kinds of validity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal Validity&lt;/strong&gt;: Does the treatment cause the dependent variable in this study?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External Validity&lt;/strong&gt;: Does the treatment generalize across persons, settings, treatment variables and measurement variables? In other words, are the findings generalize in some way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;handout&#34;&gt;Handout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;./6_Confidence_NOTES.pdf&#34;&gt;Week 6 Handout (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;observational-studies-and-large-n-methods&#34;&gt;Observational Studies and Large N Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we want to study things where we cannot randomly assign participants to the independent variable. In that case, we can only conduct &lt;strong&gt;observational studies&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Observational Studies&lt;/strong&gt; are research projects where we don&amp;rsquo;t assign values to the independent variable. We just see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of these projects include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does living in a rural area predict conservative political attitudes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some reasons that people are not getting the COVID-19 vaccine?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do people perceive others who are vaccinated or not vaccinated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To analyze the data in observational studies, we often require large N statistical methods. These are statistics tests that we use to analyze observational studies. For these methods, we care about the &lt;strong&gt;population&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;parameter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;sample&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;statistic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;population-parameters&#34;&gt;Population Parameters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parameters&lt;/em&gt; are aspects of the population that we care about. They are often denoted using Greek letters ( $\mu$, $\pi$, $\alpha$, $\beta$). They capture something that is true for the entire population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of this include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total number of registered Republicans and Democrats in the United States&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total number of people in the US who love vanilla ice cream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, remember that it is difficult to study the entire population. Think back to the week on survey deign and sampling. We cannot expect to ask everyone in the population. Therefore, we can only expect to &lt;strong&gt;estimate&lt;/strong&gt; the population parameters &lt;em&gt;using statistics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;statistics&#34;&gt;Statistics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Statistics&lt;/em&gt; are estimates of the population using data that we gather from a subset of the population. We collect the samples using the sampling methods discussed earlier in the quarter (remember: Probability versus nonprobability sampling?). We can calculate sample statistics like mean from the sample and use them to predict the population. Sample statistics are usually denoted by letters (p, a, b).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question then becomes: How do we know how &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; our predictions are? To answer this question, think back to the first week when we discussed models in this section. Remember that models are inherently missing something. Sampling statistics are models of the population. So how do we know how correct our models are especially since each of the sampling methods can be imperfect? We can use &lt;strong&gt;confidence Intervals&lt;/strong&gt;, which signals how &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; we are about our predictions. They show us a range of values [lower, upper] that is possible for the population parameter to lie given the findings from our sample. The most common confidence interval is the 95%, which shows that we are confident that the true population parameter (usually mean) is within the bounds of the calculated range 95% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways to remember the gist of a confidence interval:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When calculating confidence intervals, you are casting a net for the true population mean. Therefore, the wider the net you cast, the more likely you are to get it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When calculating confidence intervals, you are opening an umbrella to keep yourself dry in a rainstorm. The larger the umbrella, the more likely it is that you keep yourself dry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;calculating-confidence-intervals&#34;&gt;Calculating Confidence Intervals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To calculate a confidence interval, we need three pieces of information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mean (or parameter of interest)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sample size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The confidence percentage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-confidence-percentage&#34;&gt;The Confidence Percentage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to determine how wide of a net to cast to ensure success. Traditionally, this is 95%. But, we can have other percentages as well. From there, we need to get our corresponding z-score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Percent&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;z-score&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;90%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1.65&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;95%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1.96&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;99%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2.57&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-mean-or-any-other-sample-statistic&#34;&gt;The Mean (or any other sample statistic)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For means, we can compute this as we usually compute averages from sample statistics^[For means, this is often denoted as $\overline{x}$]. Essentially, this component is a descriptive statistic that we derive from the sample we have drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-standard-error&#34;&gt;The Standard Error&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. This is based on the sample size and is computed as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
SE = \sqrt{\frac{p \times (1 - p)}{N}}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;confidence-interval&#34;&gt;Confidence Interval&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulling this together, the way we calculate a confidence interval is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\overline{x} \pm z(\sqrt{\frac{p \times (1 - p)}{N}})
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-example-of-how-to-calculate-a-confidence-interval&#34;&gt;An Example of How to Calculate a Confidence Interval&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose I polled a sample of Northwestern students to whether or not the approve of the quarter system. I want to predict whether the entire population of students approve the quarter system over the semester system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, I polled 40 students outside of the Norris University Center. I get the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mean: .75 say they approve of the quarter system&lt;br&gt;
N: 40&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to compute a 95% Confidence Interval&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I calculate the standard error&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
SE = \sqrt{\frac{.75 \times (1 - .75)}{40}} \approx 0.06846532
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I plug it into the broader equation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
.75 \pm 1.96(0.06846532)
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
.75 \pm 0.134192
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the result is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
[0.615808, 0.884192] \ \text{or} \ [0.62, 0.88]
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bow, suppose I take the same condition but I want to estimate a 90% confidence interval. Here, I can use the same standard error (since no part of that has changed) and rewrite the calculations as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
.75 \pm 1.65(0.06846532)
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
.75 \pm 0.1129678
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
[0.6370322, 0.8629678] \ \text{or} \ [0.63, 0.86]
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, the interval in the 90% is smaller than the 95% since we are casting a smaller net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, now I am interested in calculating a 99% confidence interval. I can use the same conditions as I have before and rerun the math. Here is how that looks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
.75 \pm 2.57(0.06846532)
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
.75 \pm 0.1759559
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
[0.5740441, 0.9259559] \ \text{or} \ [0.57, 0.93]
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that, compared to the 95% interval, this interval is wider and this is because we have casted a bigger net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing up the scenario, suppose I am interested in the same question as before but instead of sampling 40 students, I have sampled 400 students outside of Norris instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the same 95% confidence interval, I can follow the same steps as before, starting with the standard error calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
SE = \sqrt{\frac{.75 \times (1 - .75)}{400}} \approx 0.02165064
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, we can continue the calculations by plugging everything into the main equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
.75 \pm 1.96(0.02165064)
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
.75 \pm 0.04243525
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
[0.7075647, 0.7924353] \ \text{or} \ [0.70, 0.79]
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that, with the bigger sample, even on the same confidence level, our confidence interval closes around the mean. This is because a larger sample allows us to get a better sense of the population, making it a more precise estimate (as opposed to accurate since we are still not sure if our sample is actually good at capturing the true mean.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week 8$:$ Qualitative Research Methods</title>
      <link>https://lin-jennifer.github.io/courses/ps210/week8/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://lin-jennifer.github.io/courses/ps210/week8/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;handout&#34;&gt;Handout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;./8_Qualitative_NOTES.pdf&#34;&gt;Week 8 Handout (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until this point, we have largely focused on large-N and quantitative research methods including descriptive statistics, experiments, surveys, confidence intervals and regressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we now turn to small-N and qualitative research methods. These methods are based on text-based data and you study a small number of cases in great detail. Data analysis is based on finding patterns in the process or entity of interest. Common types of qualitative methods include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Historical Methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In-Depth Interviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus Groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participant Observation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-methods&#34;&gt;Historical Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historical Methods are based primarily based on primary source research methods where you look at documents stored in archives and draw conclusions based on these documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A subfield in American politics that is built off of the historical methods, primary source approach is &lt;strong&gt;American Political Development (APD)&lt;/strong&gt;, which studies that continuity and change over time in American politics, including how the state was built and how society, and its institutions, has changed across the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of a study that uses the APD method is Lacombe (2019). In this paper, Lacombe is interested in the way the the NRA develops a social identity among their members and how they can use this social identity to mobilize their membership base in political action. To do this, he coded 79 years of the &lt;em&gt;American Rifleman&lt;/em&gt; magazine and letters to the editor in major American newspapers and conducts content analyses of these letters and entries. The results show that the NRA created and channeled a social identity in all resources to build influence in mass arenas and that this identity is powerful in mobilizing the membership base in political action. It has become more powerful over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;interviews&#34;&gt;Interviews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviews are based on conversations with subjects or groups of interest. Types of interviews include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structured Interviews&lt;/strong&gt;: Provide a set number of questions for each participant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unstructured Interviews&lt;/strong&gt;: Broad topics for conversations and depending on the answers, you respond flexibly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semi-Structured Interviews&lt;/strong&gt;: A mix of questions and free flowing discussions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;focus-groups&#34;&gt;Focus Groups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another type of qualitative research method that stems out of interviews are &lt;strong&gt;focus groups&lt;/strong&gt;. These are centered around a group of people who discuss a topic moderated by a facilitator. The goal is often to arrive at a solution of a issue, evaluate a program, understanding concepts etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectively, interviews and focus groups happen more in sociology than in political science. Common topics of focus groups I have seen include experiences of the LGBTQIA+ peoples in various social groups such as civic organizations and churches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;participant-observation&#34;&gt;Participant Observation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participant Observation&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;ethnography&lt;/strong&gt;, is a research method where researchers go to the community, join the group and observe their behavior without being too actively involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of this research method is Cramer (2012). In this paper, she was interested in why people vote against their self-interests and use rural Americans as a case study. People in rural America tend to be poor and less educated, which makes their policy interests align more with the agenda of the Democrats. However, they do not vote for the Democrats. To find out why, Cramer visited 37 regularly congregating discussion groups in coffee shops and bookstores across 27 communities across Wisconsin between May 2007 and May 2011. She observed and recorded their conversations to learn about their attitudes about politics without intervening in their conversations. her results emphasized the importance of group consciousness in personal political decisionmaking. Rural Americans collectively despise urban Americans as they blame the urban residents and politicians from urban areas for all of their problems. Therefore, they vote against the Democrat party, who champions city interests and whose politicians are more likely from cities than small towns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-qualitative-meets-quantitative&#34;&gt;Where Qualitative meets Quantitative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text as Data&lt;/strong&gt; methods take qualitative data and quantify it to meaningful data that we can use statistical methods to analyze. Texts are treated as a &amp;ldquo;bag of words&amp;rdquo; to analyze using dictionaries. This allows us to find patterns in large sums of text without necessarily needing to read each text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of this combination of qualitative and quantitative method is a paper that I have been working on. In this paper, I wanted to investigate whether Democrats and Republicans appeal to different moral values and to what extent they align with the moral values that are championed by their base. Past research has suggested that Democrats and Republicans appeal to different moral values in their press releases, church sermons, and platforms. So for this study, I was interested in national conventions, which are focused on getting voters excited for the election and willing to mobilize on the party&amp;rsquo;s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this project, my methods are summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collect transcripts of speeches delivered at the Democrat and Republican National Convention from 2008 to 2020&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parse data using the Moral Foundations Dictionary with text as data methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code data based on the definitions of the foundations to see how well the dictionary does in sorting the moral appeals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This provides me with both qualitative and quantitative data to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the qualitative data, we can draw parallel conclusions as the quantitative data. For example, the Harm foundation is interested in caring and protecting vulnerable peoples. This is a core value of the Democrat party. The dictionary characterized Bernie Sanders&#39; 2020 Democrat National Convention speech as a good example of appeals to the Harm foundation. If we read the speech, we can see why&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as I am here, I will work with progressives, with moderates, and yes, with conservatives to preserve this nation from a threat that so many of our heroes fought and died to defeat. This president is not just a threat to our democracy, but by rejecting science, he has put our lives and health in jeopardy. Trump has attacked doctors and scientists trying to protect us from the pandemic while refusing to take strong action to produce the masks, gowns, and gloves our healthcare workers desperately need. Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Trump golfs. His actions fanned this pandemic resulting in over 170,000 deaths and a nation still unprepared to protect its people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As another example, the Authority foundation emphasizes traditions, rule of law, and respect for authority. This is a core value for the Republican party and the text methods coded the speech by Rudy Giuliani in the 2020 Republican National Convention as a good example of appeals to this value. The excerpt of his speech seem to parallel this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear that a vote for Biden and the Democrats creates the risk that you will bring this lawlessness to your city, to your town, to your suburb. There is no question that this awesome job of restoring safety for our people cannot be done from your basement, Joe. There&amp;rsquo;s also no question that President Trump will fight with all his strengths to preserve the American system of government and our way of life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the parties do appeal to different moral values but I also find that they use the value systems of the opposite party to mobilize moderate and swing voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study, and the others that I showed you in this section, demonstrate the use to qualitative data in Political Science research.&lt;/p&gt;
